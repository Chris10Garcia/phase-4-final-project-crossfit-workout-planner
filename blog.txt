topic: React Context


- in React, to pass data, you need to go from parent to child
- for some components, that is ok
- for other components, you need to drill very fall down, and that can be problematic

- context allows you to pass data as far deep as you like without having to drill the data all the way down
- to do this, you need to use createContext() and useContext()


- createContext does exactly what it sounds like, creates a Context object. the value you provide is the default value as a "last resort".
- wrap the component with contextObject.Provider. This provides the context object to the component and all child components regardless of level
- value prop: the value all the compoments that are wrapped will read. The value can be any type (object, string, etc)

- useContext is a react hook that lets you read and subscribe to context you created via createContext
- it searches for the closest context.provider above
